excerpt: 'Accurately determining the molecular subtypes of breast cancer is important for the prognosis of breast cancer patients and can guide treatment selection. In this study, we develop a deep learning-based model for predicting the molecular subtypes of breast cancer directly from the diagnostic mammography and ultrasound images.'
