excerpt: 'We propose an explainable task-specific synthesis network, which adapts weights automatically for specific sequence generation tasks and provides interpretability and reliability from two sides: (1) visualize and quantify the contribution of each input sequence in the fusion stage by a trainable task-specific weighted average module; (2) highlight the area the network tried to refine during synthesizing by a task-specific attention module.'
