collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-2-1-Synthesis-based
excerpt: 'In this study, not only do we propose arbitrary 3D/4D sequence generation within one model to generate any specified target sequence, but also we are able to rank the importance of each sequence based on a new metric estimating the difficulty of a sequence being generated. Furthermore, we also exploit the generation inability of the model to extract regions that contain unique information for each sequence.'
